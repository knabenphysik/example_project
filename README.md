# Preparation for Machine Learning / Deep Learning

This is the code repository for where I embark on learning and expose myself towards to Machine Learning (ML). 

Problem statement was prepared by HT Consulting (Asia) Sdn. Bhd. but the python code was written by myself.

**Please note that the code in written in [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook.**
